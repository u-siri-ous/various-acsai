fill the square in dst_points with white (they are grey) done
cv2.fillConvexPoly(bg, dst_float, (255,255,255))

resize mandorlo to do bitwise and   doesnt work, it needs to be resized to mask dimension
shape = bg.shape[:2]
cv2.resize(slanted, shape)

then do bitwise and between the bg and the slanted image
cv2.bitwise_and(img, bg, mask=)
