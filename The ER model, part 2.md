Here, we talk about the **strategies** to design an ER model

### Top-down

In the top-down strategy, the schema is obtained by **refining** the more general and abstract starting model

### Bottom-up

In the bottom-up strategy, the schema starts from decomposing initial specification in simple schemas which are then **fused** to create the bigger schema

#### Inside-out

Inside-out begins with the identification of only a few important concepts and, based on these, the design proceeds, spreading outward **radially**

### Mixed strategy - a combination of the two

The designer divides the requirements into separate components *as in the bottom-up* 

At the same time, it defines a **skeleton scheme**, containing the main concepts of the application *as in top-down*
