The goals of unsupervised learning are:
* To discover relationships between the data
	* Clustering
* To generate new data
	* Image generation

In this class we learn about **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

**IDEA**: Adversaries can help with learning

Suppose that we're trying to create a perfect soccer goalie

The supervised approach:
* Data: Videos of penalty kicks
* Features to output actions to take

The adversary for this kind of action can be a perfect goalie and penalty kicker that challenges your goalie

Create 2 NNs and make them "fight" eachother
The 1st one is the **generator** G and the 2nd is the **discriminator** D
In the scenario of fake art generation, G creates the fake art and D detects it (i.e. gives probabilities of being real vs fake)

*G is assumed to be a FFNN for this lecture*
## How to train a GAN

G(z) = image generated by G
D(x) = probability that x is real

G has to fool D, and D aims to detect fakes, so minimize D(G(z)) and maximize D(x) when x is real

Input:
* z (used to create the fake G(z))
* x real

Update D using Stochastic Gradient Ascent
