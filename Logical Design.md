The aim of [logical design](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~angelo.montanari/logicDesign.pdf) is to **construct a relational schema** that correctly and efficiently represents all of the information described by an ER schema produced during the conceptual design phase

The restructuring step of an ER schema can be sub-divided into a series of tasks to be carried out in sequence: 

* **Analysis of redundancies**
* **Removing generalizations** 
* **Partitioning and merging of entities and relationships**
* **Selection of primary identifiers**
