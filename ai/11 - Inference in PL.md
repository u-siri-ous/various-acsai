### Monotonicity of entailment

The set of entailed sentences can only increase as information is added to the knowledge base
For any sentences α and β:
<center><b>if KB ⊨ α then KB∧β ⊨ α</b></center>

i.e., **β can't invalidate what was already inferred on α**

### Deductive system

A deductive system is used to derive, infer and deduce formulae by applying rules based on given axioms

### Inference rules

I can infer $\psi$:
* from sentences in the form $\phi$ $\rightarrow$ $\psi$                  **modus ponens** (unidirectional)
* and $\phi$ from sentences in the form $\phi$ $\wedge$ $\psi$         **and-elimination**
