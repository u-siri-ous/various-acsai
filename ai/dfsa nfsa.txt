NFA and DFA are two types of finite automata, which are mathematical models used to represent the behavior of systems.

NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) is a finite automaton where for some cases, there may be multiple transitions possible for a single input symbol from a single state. 
This means that there is an inherent ambiguity in the behavior of the NFA for some inputs.

DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is a finite automaton where there is only one transition possible for each input symbol from a single state. 
This means that the behavior of the DFA is deterministic and unambiguous for all inputs.

NFSA (Nondeterministic Finite State Automaton) and DFSA (Deterministic Finite State Automaton) are similar to NFA and DFA, respectively, but are used more specifically to describe 
the behavior of systems modeled as finite state automata.

In summary, the difference between NFA and DFA is that the former allows for multiple transitions for a single input symbol, while the latter allows only one transition.
Non-deterministic : when the same action leads to different outputs/state
 
The difference between NFSA and DFSA is that the former is used to describe the behavior of systems modeled as finite state automata that allow multiple transitions, 
while the latter is used to describe the behavior of systems modeled as finite state automata that are deterministic.
