# Logic-based agents/Introduction to propositional logic**

## Knowledge-based Agents

The knowledge base in the primary component of knowledge-based agents

A KB is a set of **sentences**, each expressed in a **knowledge representation language**, with sentences that are primary and not derived from others called **axioms**

Each time the agent is called, it performs three steps:

1. **TELL** the KB what it perceives
2. **ASK** the KB what action should be performed
3. **TELL** the KB what action was chosen and executes it

## Logic/Propositional logic

A logic consists of:

1. Syntax
2. Semantics
3. Deductive system

Propositional logic (PL) deals with **propositions** (aka sentences or statements)
