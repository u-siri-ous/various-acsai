## ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

[ORB](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/d89/tutorial_py_orb.html) comes to our help when we need real-time and cost effective replacement to SIFT

It builds on [FAST](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0c/tutorial_py_fast.html) and [BRIEF](https://medium.com/@deepanshut041/introduction-to-brief-binary-robust-independent-elementary-features-436f4a31a0e6)

It adds to them:

* The addition of a fast and accurate orientation component to FAST

* The efficient computation of oriented BRIEF features

* Analysis of variance and correlation of oriented
BRIEF features

* A learning method for de-correlating BRIEF features under rotational invariance, leading to better performance in *nearest-neighbor* applications
