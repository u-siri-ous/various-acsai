## [AKAZE](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d70/tutorial_akaze_matching.html) 

AKAZE rises from the problem of non-preserved boundaries and smoothness on objects treated with Gaussian blur in SIFT and SURF

The aim is to detect and descrice features in nonlinear scale spaces, blurring small details adaptively to preserve boundaries

### Nonlinear Diffusion Filtering

### Fast Explicit Diffusion

### AKAZE

- The scale space

The nonlinear scale space is discretized in a series of *octaves* and *sub-levels*, and each one is mapped to a corresponding scale $\sigma$, and converted to time units
